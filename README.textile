h2. Description

'ActiveLdap' is a ruby extension library which provides a
clean objected oriented interface to LDAP library.  It was
inspired by ActivRecord. This is not nearly as clean or as
flexible as ActiveRecord, but it is still trivial to define
new objects and manipulate them with minimal difficulty.

For example and usage - read the
"document":http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/.

h2. Prerequisites

- Ruby intepreter :=
One of them:
* "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org (1.8.x or 1.9.1)
* "JRuby":http://jruby.codehaus.org/ =:
- LDAP client :=
JRuby doesn't need to install new library because JRuby
has builtin LDAP support. Ruby users need one of them:
* "Ruby/LDAP":http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-ldap/
* "Net::LDAP":http://rubyforge.org/projects/net-ldap/ =:
- ActiveModel :=
A toolkit for building modeling frameworks like Active
Record and Active Resource. =:

h2. Notes

* Only GSSAPI SASL support exists due to Ruby/LDAP limitations

h2. Rails

There is a small rails plugin included that allows the use
of a file named 'config/ldap.yml' in the config directory of
your rails app. This file has a similar function to the
'database.yml' file that allows you to set your database
connection settings per environment. Similarly, the ldap.yml
file allows settings to be set for development, test, and
production environments. For instance, the development entry
would look something like the following:

<pre>
!!!plain
development:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 389
  base: dc=localhost
  bind_dn: cn=admin,dc=localhost
  password: secret
</pre>

To install, simply add the following code to your Gemfile:

<pre>
gem 'activeldap', '3.1.0', :require => 'active_ldap'
</pre>

You should also depend on an LDAP adapter such as Net::LDAP or Ruby/LDAP.
The following example uses Ruby/LDAP:

<pre>
gem 'ruby-ldap', :require => 'ldap'
</pre>

Bundler will install the gems automatically when you run 'bundle install'.

You also need to include the ActiveLdap railtie in config/application.rb, after
the other railties:

<pre>
require "active_ldap/railtie"
</pre>

When your application starts up, the plugin will call
ActiveLdap::Base.setup_connection using the parameters
specified for your current environment.

h2. Model

Here is some examples.

app/model/member.rb:

<pre>
class Member < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => 'uid',
               :classes => ['person', 'posixAccount']
  belongs_to :primary_group, :class_name => "Group",
             :foreign_key => "gidNumber", :primary_key => "gidNumber"
  belongs_to :groups, :many => 'memberUid'
end
</pre>

app/model/group.rb:

<pre>
class Group < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :dn_attribute => "cn", :classes => ['posixGroup']
  has_many :members, :wrap => "memberUid"
  has_many :primary_members,
           :foreign_key => 'gidNumber',
           :primary_key => 'gidNumber'
end
</pre>

app/model/ou.rb:

<pre>
class Ou < ActiveLdap::Base
  ldap_mapping :prefix => "",
               :classes => ["top", "organizationalUnit"]
end
</pre>
